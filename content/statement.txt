<br/>ARTIST STATEMENT

The objective of my painting is to embrace the viewer by selecting subjects that portray the common denominators between people. I attempt to offer a synopsis of familiar experiences translated into paintings. The central themes of work, play, relationships, and daily sustenance are interconnected throughout the paintings. The images of basic life experiences create a venue for the viewer to transfer themselves into a similar world. My objective is to use art as a means of unification. We all experience the mundane. By transcending time and place, I try to provide an entrance point to empathize with people outside our daily routine. I prefer thought-provoking, emotionally stimulating, easily identifiable subjects. The bodies are shaped through my sense memory of weight, movement, and the emotional body language of the subjects. The fluid, fragmented portrait of the body provides the juxtaposition with the dogma of the scene. I am a self-taught painter. My paintings are not physically accurate or intellectually challenging. To reach people is to feel their souls. That is my goal as a painter.
